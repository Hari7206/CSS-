<!-- In this we learn about the unit of the relative property of the unit 
 as we learn in our previous chapter about the absoulate property so here also we learn the relative property
 so relative property can be different for any element . 
 the three major element of the relative units are

    Hello Wordl!
    <div class="parent">
        parent
        <div class="child"> 
            Child
        </div>

    <!-- some rule of em 
      its when we say our em is 1 then it means its multiply by the pixel of the parent like 
      like if parent tag have pixel of 20px
      and we give the em to the 3 so its pixel will be 60px  and in font it goes for the parent tag and for
      other element like the width its goes for itself font element pixel 
      
      also for the width like property 
      if our font size is 60 pixek so our width multiply by its element if we give the 2em  width so our width will be 120pixel -->

      <!-- no we gonna learn about the rem or we can call it the root em its fix our value with the help of the root tag of our tag font size 
       like if our root tag font size is 80px 

       and our rem is 7rem so our rem px is 560px -->
       <!-- one more element we have the vh and vw its means that our vh means the viewport height and the vw means the view port width 
        we can also call the veiwport as the browser cause it work by the browser height and width  -->
